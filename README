This repo contains multiple implementations of the same API. An API for the Eboshi time tracking and invoicing system. Each implementation shares the MySQL database schema, and a language-agnostic test suite written in shell.

To run the tests for one implementation, run e.g. `make rack`.

Each implementation lives in its own subdirectory, and must implement bin/setup and bin/teardown.

bin/setup: does everything it needs to do to get the server running. this includes installing dependencies.
bin/teardown: does everything it needs to do to shut down the server and clean up any test artifacts.
