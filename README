This repo contains multiple implementations of the same API. An API for the Eboshi time tracking and invoicing system. Each implementation shares the MySQL database schema, and a language-agnostic test suite written in shell.

To run all the tests for all implementations, run `make`. To run the tests for one implementation, run e.g. `make ruby`.
